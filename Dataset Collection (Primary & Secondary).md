For my robot project, I used both primary and secondary data to train and test the system.

Primary Data

This is the data I got directly from my robot during testing, such as:

Voice recordings from real people

Sensor readings from the robot (like touch or motion)

Images or videos the robot captured by itself
This helped the robot learn in a more real and natural way.

Secondary Data

These are already available datasets I found and used to support the training, like:

Voice datasets from online sources (for better voice recognition)

Public image datasets to help the robot know what it sees

Some simulated data used for learning actions and paths
They helped the robot train faster and become more accurate.
