-To check how well the robot’s ML models perform, we use several key methods:

  .Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correct predictions the robot makes out of all tries.

  .Precision: Shows how many of the robot’s positive predictions are actually correct.

  .Recall: Tells us how many of the true positive cases the robot successfully finds.

  .Confusion Matrix: A detailed table that shows true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives to find where the model makes mistakes.

  .Real-World Testing: Running the robot in real-life situations to see if it can handle different environments and unexpected events.

  .User Feedback: Getting responses from people using the robot to learn if it works well and meets their needs.
