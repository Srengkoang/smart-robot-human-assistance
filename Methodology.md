1. Problem Identification
We identified the need for a robot capable of [insert task, e.g., navigating obstacles or recognizing human gestures]. The goal was to improve task efficiency using AI.

2. Data Collection
We collected relevant data such as [images/sensor data/sound], either manually or from online datasets, and cleaned it for model training.

3. Model Selection
An AI model suitable for the task, such as a [CNN for image tasks or RNN for sequence tasks], was chosen and trained using [e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch].

4. Integration into Robot System
The trained model was embedded into the robot using [e.g., Raspberry Pi or Arduino], allowing it to make real-time decisions based on inputs.

5. Testing and Evaluation
The system was tested in real environments. Results were analyzed to ensure the robot performed accurately, with improvements made where necessary.
