To ensure optimal performance of the robot system, several machine learning models were chosen based on their strengths:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):
Used for visual perception tasks such as image classification and object detection. CNNs help the robot recognize and interpret its environment from camera input.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) / Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):
Ideal for handling sequential data like voice or sensor time series. These models enable the robot to understand commands and maintain context over time.

Support Vector Machines (SVM):
Applied for simple classification tasks where the data is well-structured. SVM helps in identifying patterns with high accuracy when the dataset is limited.

Reinforcement Learning (RL):
Enables the robot to learn optimal actions by interacting with its environment. It improves the robotâ€™s decision-making through rewards and penalties.

Deep Q-Network (DQN):
A type of deep reinforcement learning used for complex decision-making. DQN allows the robot to learn strategies in dynamic or unknown environments.
