Through this project, I learned how machine learning models can help robots work more accurately and interact better with humans. It was exciting to see how models like CNN, RNN, and DQN helped the robot recognize voices, understand situations, and move properly, which some of the things I used in this project, like certain AI models and techniques, were things I had never learned or even heard about before. One challenge was tuning the robotâ€™s sensitivity and path planning to make it work safely and efficiently. Some of the tools and AI models I used were things I had never learned or even heard about before, which made the learning process even more meaningful. However, the final result showed great improvement, and I believe using AI in robots is a smart way to make them more helpful in real-life situations. With more testing and better training data, the robot could become even more reliable and human-friendly in the future.
