Choosing AI and ML for robot design is a smart way to give robots clear and effective functions. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are powerful for helping robots see and recognize faces, objects, or their surroundings. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are good for understanding patterns over time, like human speech, movements, or repeated actions, which improves how robots interact. Support Vector Machines (SVM) help the robot make clear decisions, such as identifying whether a person is smiling or frowning. Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) allow the robot to learn through trial and error—like learning the best way to move or respond in real time—which improves their decision-making and adaptability in dynamic environments.
